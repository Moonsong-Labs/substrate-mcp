## Usage with Claude Code

To use this MCP server with Claude Code, add it to your Claude Code configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "substrate-mcp": {
      "command": "substrate-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If you built the server locally instead of installing it, use the full path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "substrate-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/substrate-mcp/target/release/substrate-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want, you can add it directly using the Claude Code cli with the following command:

```claude mcp add substrate /path/to/substrate-mcp/target/release/substrate-mcp```
